# StayWell Student Accommodation SQL Project
This project represents a comprehensive portfolio of work from the CTS 2433 - SQL Database Design & Programming course, completed from May to August 2025. It demonstrates a comprehensive, hands-on understanding of SQL by developing a functional database for the StayWell Student Accommodation company.


The project addresses a critical business need to transition from manual record-keeping and communication to an efficient, e-commerce-based model. By building a robust relational database, this work provides a scalable foundation for managing all data related to properties, owners, and services, laying the groundwork for future online booking and mobile applications.

## Objective
This project provides a practical framework for solving key data-related challenges faced by a property management company. Through a series of carefully designed exercises, the database addresses questions such as:


### How do we efficiently manage and retrieve information about all properties, owners, and service requests? 
The project demonstrates creating a centralized relational database and performing complex queries, including multi-table joins and subqueries, to quickly access comprehensive property and owner data.

### How can we automate key business logic without manual calculations? 
The use of functions within queries automates calculations, such as determining monthly rent discounts for properties. Stored procedures also streamline routine tasks like adding new properties or updating owner information.

### How do we handle large datasets and ensure data integrity? 
The project shows how to create tables from existing data, modify table structures, and apply data integrity rules using foreign keys and check constraints. It also utilizes cursors to process multiple rows in a controlled, programmatic way.

### How can we secure sensitive information and control user access? 
The project addresses security by demonstrating how to grant and revoke specific user privileges on tables and columns. This ensures that users only have access to the information necessary for their roles.
